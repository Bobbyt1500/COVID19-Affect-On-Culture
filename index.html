          <p class="lead m-5">On January 21, 2020 the first COVID-19 case in the United States was confirmed. 
            Soon after, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. People were encouraged to stay home, and limit their contact with others to avoid spreading 
            the virus. Everything began to shut down and move to a virtual setting. This was a massive change to our everyday life and culture.</p>

          <p class="lead m-5">Due to the pandemic things like concerts, art galleries, and other events deemed non-essential
            have been postponed, cancelled, or closed. This has had a massive impact on the creative sector and its audience. It is said that in "film, advertising, and fashion as well as creative occupations such as musicians, artists, performers, and designers... we estimate losses of 2.7 million jobs and more than $150 billion in sales" 
            (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/lost-art-measuring-covid-19s-devastating-impact-on-americas-creative-economy/">brookings.edu</a>). Inorder to keep the arts alive, artists have had to use their creativity to find new ways of sharing their work online. Two very succesful new ideas have been virtual concerts and online musuem gallerys. In addition to helping the artist, 
            people who may not have been able to make an in-person event before could now attend. 
            Non-performing artists have also found new ways to share their work online. Videos of 
            talented artists creating their work have recently became popular on social media. These 
            artists have created masterclasses and workshops too for people looking to get into the hobby or advance their skills. </p>

          <p class="lead m-5">
            As people began to stay home, they also transitioned to remote work.
            Since most Americans spend most of their day working, this was a massive change to their livestyle.
            For example, the "Morning Commute" was once a staple of the average Americans day. 
            Now, technology like "Zoom", "Google Meets", or "Microsoft Teams" are more common in the average daily routine. 
            In addition, company culture has also changed. 
            Employees are no longer interacting face to face, or even on a daily basis. 
            This can make it challenging to maintain a relationship with your fellow co-workers.
            In person conversations allow you to read "non-verbal cues", building "rapport and trust" (<a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/articles/2020/how-the-pandemic-can-change-workplace-culture-for-the-better.html" target="_blank">strategyand.pwc.com</a>).
            To combat this problem, many companies have created extra virtual get-togethers and team building activities.
            This way co-workers can continue to stay connected, even though they are far apart.

            Every year many Americans celebrate things like birthdays, graduations, weddings, holidays, and more.
            Unfortunately, the pandemic has caused many of these to be postponed or even cancelled.
            In our culture, these events hold a lot of meaning and value. 
            For example, a high school graduation symbolizes not only the work they have done to graduate, but also the moving on to a new stage in life.
            Most families also only get to see many of their relatives during things like Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations.
            Because of this, many efforts have been made to still have celebrations, even if they are online.
            Read below about graduations and weddings, to see what they are like now.

                    Many people have a "Dream Wedding" or a grand event with lots of people, and a luxorious location.
                    With the COVID-19 pandemic, this style of large in-person event is no longer possible.
                    Couples have had to adjust their expectations, and it has had an effect on our wedding culture.
                    Usually, people will spend tons of hours planning their wedding, and it ends up costing a lot of money.
                    Now, people are beginning to wonder if it is worth it. 
                    For example, Miranda Geng says "Wedding culture is usually sold as ‘your perfect day’ and once that wasn’t possible anymore, I saw the reality of what I was spending on one day and it was a wake-up call" (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/how-coronavirus-could-change-wedding-culture-even-after-pandemic-ends-n1185506" target="_blank">nbcnews.com</a>).
                    It's not just her either. "According to Zola, a wedding registry and planning company, more couples are scheduling weekday weddings in 2020..." (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/how-coronavirus-could-change-wedding-culture-even-after-pandemic-ends-n1185506" target="_blank">nbcnews.com</a>).
                    Overall, no one knows for sure what weddings after the pandemic will look like. 
                    However, it is very likely that COVID could change wedding culture forever.

                    Unlike other events, a graduation is not really something that can be postponed.
                    Schools and Universities have had to find ways to have a graduation ceremony, even if not in the traditional way.
                    The most popular solution is a virtual-live streamed graduation.
                    In these virtual gradutions, schools usually either show a picture of the person, or a pre-recorded video of them walking across the stage.
                    This way, each student is still recognized. 
                    But as you probably know, graduations are more than just recognizing the student.
                    They are a physical ritual that marks a huge milestone in one's life.
                    The class of 2020, and now 2021 are missing out on something they may have looked forward to their whole life.

            Perhaps one of the most difficult areas to convert to virtual is education.
            Education for younger children is especially difficult as they are not used to using technology for work.
            Both teachers and students have had to work together to adapt to the new reality of virtual learning.
            Before the pandemic, it was common for teachers to create hands on, physical learning. 
            Now, students have to learn from mostly presentations. 
            Students also can't collaborate as much. 
            Usually, students could easily work together on a project. 
            However, being far apart, this has proven to be a little more difficult.
            
          </p>

          <p class="lead my-4">
            In addition to the new changes with learning, school events and extracurriculars have also been affected.
            For example, many schools have a field day where students can all get together outside and play games.
            This is an event that many students look forward to once it gets around the end of the year.
            Unfortunately, events like these have been cancelled as they just aren't possible to arrange.
            Clubs and sports have also had a similar problem.
            Many students look forward to their sport as it is a big part of their lives. 
            With the COVID-19 Pandemic, many sports have been severly limited or even cancelled.
